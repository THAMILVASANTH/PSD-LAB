   <h2>Subramania Bharati</h2>
	C. Subramania Bharathi (11 December 1882 – 11 September 1921) was a Tamil writer,
 poet, journalist, Indian independence activist, social reformer and polyglot. He was bestowed the title "Bharathi" for his excellence in poetry.
 He was a pioneer of modern Tamil poetry and is considered one of the greatest Tamil literary figures of all time. He is popularly known by his mononymous
 title "Bharathi/ Bharathiyaar," and also by the other title "Mahakavi Bharathi" ("the great poet Bharathi"). His numerous works included fiery songs
 kindling patriotism during the Indian Independence movement.[2][3] He fought for the emancipation of women, against child marriage, vehemently opposed
 the caste system, and stood for reforming society and religion. He was also in solidarity with Dalits and Muslims.[4][5]

	Born in Ettayapuram of Tirunelveli district (present-day Thoothukudi) in 1882, Bharathi had his early education in Tirunelveli and Varanasi and worked as
 a journalist with many newspapers, including The Hindu, Bala Bharata, Vijaya, Chakravarthini, the Swadesamitran and India. In 1908, an arrest warrant was
 issued against Bharathi by the government of British India caused him to move to Pondicherry where he lived until 1918.[6]

	His influence on Tamil literature is phenomenal, although it is said that he was proficient in around 32,[not verified in body][citation needed] including
 3 non-Indian foreign languages. His favorite language was Tamil. He was prolific in his output. He covered political, social and spiritual themes.
 The songs and poems composed by Bharathi are very often used in Tamil cinema and have become staples in the literary and musical repertoire of Tamil artistes
 throughout the world. He paved the way for modern blank verse. He wrote many books and poems on how Tamil is beautiful in nature.
